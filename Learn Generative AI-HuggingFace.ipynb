Executive overview\\nWithSecure™ Cloud Protection for Salesforce is a cloud-\\nbased security solution designed to complement the native \\nsecurity capabilities of the Salesforce platforms. \\nTogether with Salesforce, we make it easier for companies to \\nhandle their part of security under the Shared Responsibility \\nmodel used in cloud ecosystems. WithSecure™ Cloud Protec-\\ntion is an excellent choice for complementing overall security \\ncapabilities, and for ensuring that the company security strate-\\ngy also extends to cloud services. \\nWithSecure™ Cloud Protection for Salesforce provides \\ndedicated security components that mitigate the risks posed \\nby files, URLs and emails handled by Salesforce platform \\nusers, without hindering the use of Salesforce. The solution \\nalso provides rich reporting, advanced security analytics, and \\nfull audit trails, ensuring that incident response is fast and \\nefficient. Thanks to native cloud-to-cloud integration between Sales-\\nforce and WithSecure™, Cloud Protection is an optimal choice \\nfrom both security and resourcing perspectives. \\nFirst, there is no need to expend resources on deploying or \\nmaintaining middleware, such as servers or proxies, or modify-\\ning network configurations. \\nFurthermore, Salesforce uses HTTPS encryption in all their \\ncommunications, which means solutions using proxies, like \\ntraditional Cloud access security brokers (CASBs), would \\nhave to break the encryption midway , making the system less \\nsecure and much more prone to vulnerabilities. \\nFinally , tight integration enables streamlined deployment via \\nSalesforce AppExchange. The deployment takes only a few \\nminutes, eliminating the need for expensive, time intensive  \\nIT work.To summarize, WithSecureTM Cloud Protection \\nfor Salesforce offers the following benefits:\\nAdvanced Threat Protection\\n• High-fidelity detections of known and unknown malware\\n• Protection against phishing links\\n• Powered by multi-stage content analysis, real-time threat intelli-\\ngence, AI, and sandboxing\\nReal-time protection and visibility\\n• Automated scanning on upload and download\\n• Flexible on-demand and scheduled scans\\n• Click-time URL protection against dormant and mutating cyber \\nthreats\\n• Real-time visibility with full forensics trail for threat hunting\\nClick-and-go security – made with Salesforce\\n• Natively integrated, purpose-built in close collaboration with \\nSalesforce\\n• No single point of failure, no additional middleware, connectors, \\nconfiguration hassle, or additional hosting costs\\n• Up and running in minutes giving you instant value\\nWithSecure™ Cloud Protection for Salesforce3', metadata={'source': '/Users/ongbt/Personal/Learn/learn-generative-ai/withsecure-cloud-protection-salesforce-solution-overview-en.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

It offers far superior \\nprotection compared to traditional technologies:\\nOur patented scanning logic ensures a transparent threat \\ndetection process when users upload and download files, \\nthanks to seamless integration with Salesforce platforms.\\n4.2.1 Upload Protection\\nWhenever a user uploads a file to Chatter , Salesforce \\nFiles or Attachments, a multi-layered background analysis \\nprocess begins:Initial Analysis \\nA checksum (SHA1) of the file is calculated and stored in a \\nthreat detection cache within Salesforce Cloud, along with \\nfile content and its metadata. The checksum is compared to \\nthose saved in the existing threat detection cache to see if \\nthe file has been analyzed before. In this way, cloud calls can \\nbe limited and the user experience further improved. Existing \\nthreat detection results are periodically updated and expired \\nresults cleared automatically in order to ensure up-to-date \\nprotection. If analysis results are available from the cache, \\nthey are automatically used.\\nThreat Intelligence Check\\nIf no results are found in the cache, a threat intelligence check \\nis made via the WithSecure™ Security Cloud using the SHA-1 \\nchecksum. The service returns file safety reputation, preva-\\nlence and possible threats detected, automatically blocking \\nany malicious files. Depending on the settings, the system \\neither replaces the malicious files with a .txt file explaining why \\nthe original file has been removed, or simply blocks any further \\naccess to malicious files.Multi-Engine Anti-Malware\\nIf file reputation is unknown, the contents of the file are \\nuploaded to the WithSecure™ Security Cloud for further threat \\nanalysis. The file is subjected to deeper analysis by multiple \\ncomplementary anti-malware engines in order to find malware, \\nzero-day exploits and patterns of advanced threats. At this \\nstage, the analysis process utilizes the full extent of the threat \\nintelligence data and capabilities collected by WithSecure™ \\nLabs.\\nContent Filtering\\nBefore performing a threat analysis, the Cloud Protection app \\nchecks the file against the list of disallowed file types or exten-\\nsions defined in the solution settings. If the file is found with \\none of extensions or file types from the disallowed list, the app \\ntakes action to block the file. Administrator receives an secu-\\nri-ty alert according to the notification settings.\\nWith the content filtering, the organization can prevent users \\nfrom uploading inappropriate or dangerous content. For \\nexample, to minimize a risk of spreading malware, Cloud \\nProtection can be configured to block any executables (such \\nas EXE, COM) or scripts (such as VBS, PS1) uploaded to \\nSalesforce Cloud.• It detects a broader range of malicious features, patterns and \\ntrends, enabling more reliable and accurate detection, even for \\npreviously unseen malware variants\\n• By leveraging real-time threat intelligence gathered from tens of \\nmillions of security clients, it provides faster and better protection \\nagainst new and emerging threats\\n• Emulation enables the detection of malware that utilizes obfusca-\\ntion techniques\\nWithSecure™ Cloud Protection for Salesforce10', metadata={'source': '/Users/ongbt/Personal/Learn/learn-generative-ai/withsecure-cloud-protection-salesforce-solution-overview-en.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"Smart Cloud Sandbox\\nBased on threat analysis results, the system uses finetuned \\nmachine learning techniques to decide whether to send the \\nfile to the Smart Cloud Sandbox for deeper analysis. If it \\nhas suspicious risk indicators, a file is sent to the Sandbox, \\nwhere it is executed in several virtual environments to analyze \\nbehavior . By focusing analysis on malicious behavior rather \\nthan static identifiers, the Smart Cloud Sandbox is able to \\nidentify and block even the most sophisticated or zero-day \\nmalware and exploits.\\nAnalysis Results\\nBased on the final verdict, the uploaded file is categorized as \\neither harmful or clean. Depending on settings specifications, \\nthe file is removed if it is harmful or suspicious and/or the file \\nuploader and administrators are notified about the incident. If \\nno security threats are found, the file is accessible in its original \\nupload location and a file threat detection event is recorded to \\nthe scan log for further analysis and auditing, if needed. The \\nfinal verdict, file reputation and other threat analysis details \\nare stored in the threat detection cache for future use. Detec-\\ntion details of malicious files are sent to WithSecure's threat \\nintelligence service so that the next threat detection query can \\nidentify and block the threat immediately .4.2.2 Download Protection\\nDownload Protection makes sure that users cannot download \\nharmful or disallowed content from Chatter , Salesforce Files \\nor Attachments. WithSecure™ Cloud Protection goes through \\nthe same process as described above. If the file verdict is \\nalready available in the threat detection cache, the file is \\nallowed/ blocked accordingly , and if not, it will be subjected \\nto the same process as above. If the file is safe, the user will \\ndownload the file seamlessly, as per the regular Salesforce \\nuser experience. If the file is detected as harmful or disallowed, \\nthe application will block user access to the file and, depending \\non solution settings, send an alert to the administrator . Checks \\nat both upload and download stages are critical to ensure that \\nthe latest security intelligence is always used. Malware that \\nmight have bypassed the process earlier is caught later when \\nnew threat intelligence becomes available.\\n4.2.3 Manual Scanning\\nManual scanning can be used to scan Salesforce files and \\nattachments which were either added to the Salesforce Cloud \\nbefore installing WithSecure™ Cloud Protection or were exclud-\\ned from scanning by Upload and Download Protection. Addi-\\ntionally , a scheduled scan can be set to scan the full system at \\nregular intervals. The scans are executed in background without \\ninterference to the user experience or performance.\\nWithSecure™ Cloud Protection for Salesforce11\", metadata={'source': '/Users/ongbt/Personal/Learn/learn-generative-ai/withsecure-cloud-protection-salesforce-solution-overview-en.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"4.3 URL Protection\\nURL Protection is a key security function that proactive-\\nly prevents Salesforce users from accessing malicious or \\nunwanted content through web links added to Chatter posts \\nand comments, Case descriptions and comments, as well as \\nbodies of messages received via Email-To-Case. \\nThis makes it a particularly effective security component, as \\nthe early intervention greatly reduces the overall exposure \\nto malicious content, and thus attacks. For example, it will \\nprevent users from being tricked into accessing seemingly \\nlegitimate phishing sites, malicious sites, or accessing content \\nthat is deemed inappropriate in a business context, such as \\nadult or gambling sites. \\nURL Protection was created to deal efficiently with the \\nbillions of sites available on the Internet and their constantly \\nfluctuating security status. It is based on realtime lookup \\nqueries to WithSecure's scurity Cloud. All queries go through \\nseveral layers of anonymization to ensure utmost business \\nconfidentiality. \\nThe query fetches the latest reputation of the websites and \\ntheir files, based on various data points, including: IP address-\\nes, URL keywords, site patterns, extracted website metadata \\nlike iframes and file types, and website behavior like exploit \\nattempts, malicious redirects or scripts.4.3.1 URL Security Check\\nThe solution intercepts URLs that users post to Chatter or \\nforms part of the email body (Email-to-Case) and replaces \\nthem with special redirect links, as shown on the screenshot \\nbelow . The original link is included in brackets for recognition \\npurposes, but the user cannot click it. Copying is prevented by \\nobfuscating the URL. \\nIn case the link is deemed malicious based on the information \\nreceived from the query , entry to the website is blocked before \\nany content in loaded, and the end-user receives a warning. \\nWhen the user clicks a redirect link, WithSecure™ Cloud \\nProtection will send the original URL to the WithSecure™ \\nSecurity Cloud for a threat intelligence check. Based on URL \\nthreat intelligence, access to the original URL iseither allowed \\nor blocked.\\n4.3.2 URL Classification\\nURL Classification allows administrators to control and \\nenforce the web pages that Salesforce users can access. They \\ncan, for example, deny access to non work- related destina-\\ntions, such as social media sites, to avoid loss of working time. \\nSites in higher risk categories such as Adult or Gambling can be blocked to avoid potentially malicious sites and the viewing \\nof inappropriate content in the business environment and on \\ncustomer or partner portals.\\nWhen the user clicks a redirect link, WithSecure™ Cloud \\nProtection sends the original URL to the WithSecure™ Secu-\\nrity Cloud for a threat intelligence check. Based on the URL \\nthreat intelligence information, access to the original URL is \\neither allowed or blocked. \\nSolution administrators can enforce usage rules in 28 different \\ncategories: Abortion, Ad services, Adult, Alcohol and tobacco, \\nAnonymizers, Auctions, Banking, Blogs, Chat, Dating, Drugs, \\nEntertainment, Gambling, Games, Hacking, Hate, Job search, \\nPayment service, Scam, Shopping, Social networking, Soft-\\nware download.\\nWithSecure™ Cloud Protection for Salesforce12\", metadata={'source': '/Users/ongbt/Personal/Learn/learn-generative-ai/withsecure-cloud-protection-salesforce-solution-overview-en.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",
